# Retail-Data-Analytics-Customer-Segmentation-Strategy
In this retail case study, I analyzed customer purchase data to solve business challenges regarding product positioning. By correlating demographic profiles with product choice, I developed a data-backed framework for identifying high-value customer segments. The project highlights my skill in using data analytics to inform strategic decision-making.

Key Libraries used (Python):
Pandas: For handling the dataset.
Matplotlib / Seaborn: For the visualizations.
